# differentiation-and-integration-side-by-side
Differentiation and integration so that both are discussed at the same time for a class of functions.

The material discusses exercise problems in mathematics topics derivative (=growth speed) and integral (=cumulated area). The material is mostly examples and exercises. There are not really any proofs of formulas.

In most materials, integration is discussed after differentiation. On the contrary, this material tries to discuss week-by-week
* derivative of an elementary function
* integral of an elementary function
* methods (more complicated differentiation rules)
* applications
* graphical side

The material is divided to weekly packages - each class of elementary functions each week. The benefit can be that already first two weeks give an idea what differentiation and integration are. Also, new formulas can appear in a more steady pace.

Material was in use in Spring 2024. There are deficiencies and mistakes in both the content and representation.

The material is being updated in Spring 2025. You can access the material also at
